        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.</li>
          <li>Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.</li>
          <li>Imperative language – In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It simply control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call.</li>
          <li>Declarative programming – In this type of language we are concern about how it is to be done , basically here logical computation require . Here  main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it like  arrow function do .</li>

           <h2>What you need to know</h2>
           <p>Probably the most basic topic on the list. One of the most important, maybe the most important one. If you do not know how to proceed with your code, you will have a hard time. Knowing the ins and outs of basic control flow is definitely a must.</p>
        <p>This took a while for me. It does not matter if you are working on frontend or backend, the first year or so, you will probably default to console.log or maybe console.error for ‘handling’ errors. To write good applications, you definitely have to change that and replace your lazy logs with nicely handled errors. You may want to check out how to build your own Error constructor and how to catch them correctly, as well as showing the user what the actual problem is.</p>

        <h2>Java and JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”) and is used to make web pages interactive. It can insert dynamic text into HTML. JavaScript is also known as the browser’s language. JavaScript(JS) is not similar or related to Java. Both the languages have a C-like syntax and are widely used in client-side and server-side Web applications, but there are few similarities only.</p>
         <code>
        const num1 = 5;
        const num2 = 3;
        // add two numbers
        const sum = num1 + num2;

        // display the sum
        console.log('The sum of ' + num1 + '         and ' + num2 + ' is: ' + sum);
         </code>

      <article>
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.</p>
       <p>
        There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).</p>
